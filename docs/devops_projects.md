## Jenkins-Sonarqube

**Jenkins**: Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate the building, testing, and deploying of software. It's a Java-based platform with plugins for continuous integration.  

**Sonarqube**: SonarQube is a platform for analyzing software for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. It provides reports on duplicated code, coding standards, unit tests, code coverage, code complexity, comments, bugs, and security recommendations.  
In this project you will be guided how to host Jenkins and Sonarqube using docker, also how to automate CI/Cd pipeline and check code analysis.

## Build Docker using Git Actions

**Git Actions**: GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
This project is quick most simple and easy to implement on how to build a Docker container using GitHub Actions.  
We will use Python Image and create a Flask web server that serves an `index.html` file. GitHub Actions will be used to automate the container building process, ensuring that the container is built consistently for every new commit into branch.
