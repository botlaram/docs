### Jenkins-Sonarqube  
**Jenkins**: Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate the building, testing, and deploying of software. It's a Java-based platform with plugins for continuous integration.  
**Sonarqube**: SonarQube is a platform for analyzing software for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. It provides reports on duplicated code, coding standards, unit tests, code coverage, code complexity, comments, bugs, and security recommendations.  
In this project you will be guided how to host Jenkins and Sonarqube using docker, also how to automate CI/Cd pipeline and check code analysis.
